# Project Name
Mottainai

## Description

The web site is called ***Mottainai****. Mottainai is thought of as an all-encompassing Japanese term for the four Rs: **reduce**, **reuse**, **recycle** and **respect**. This meaning is exactly what the concept of this project.

As I used to be one of backpackers, I had situations that I had to throw many stuffs which were still usable since I moved frequently. Each time I threw things I felt really guilty. So I thought It would be nice if I can give or sell my belongings to other backpackers, and vice verse.

This application is the marketplace that connects backpackers and travelers in Australia so that they can have a chance to give and sell to others and avoid wast at the same time.

## User stories
I made user stories to define what functionality my application should have.

I basically managed my project using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/pq0IHI2D/project,"Trello").
